This is a fork of LuaJIT that adds these operators: !=, !, && and || without removing vanilla ones.
All modifications are done in lexer (lj_lex.c).

## Example
```lua
local nah = !true
local meh = 0 != 1
local duh = true && false
local bruh = false || true
```

It also has Lua 5.2 compatibility enabled in msvcbuild.bat file,
if you want to disable it - open msvcbuild.bat and find the line at the top
that starts with @set LJCOMPILE=cl, and remove "/DLUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT" from it.

## Building with msvcbuild.bat
Navigate here: "YOUR VISUAL STUDIO DIRECTORY/VERSION/Community/VC/Auxiliary/Build"

(for me it's "C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/VC/Auxiliary/Build")

Then find vcvars32.bat and vcvars64.bat here. Run the appropriate one depending
on if you want to build LuaJIT as x86 or x64, and then run msvcbuild.bat from the LuaJIT/src dir,
but in the same console you have run vcvars**.bat.

> **_NOTE:_**  To build LuaJIT statically (using msvcbuild.bat), type: msvcbuild.bat static

## Step by step for absolute beginners
- Run cmd.exe
- Type "YOUR VISUAL STUDIO DIRECTORY/VERSION/Community/VC/Auxiliary/Build/vcvars64.bat"
- Type "cd SOMELOCATION/luajit/src"
- Type "msvcbuild.bat" or "msvcbuild.bat static" if you want to build a static library (.lib) instead of dynamic one (.dll)
